redux store
    big whole object 
    it is kept in global central place

slices
    small parts of redux store
    to keep data separate , we make logical paritions , they are slices
    example - cartSlice,userSlice,darkthemeSlice
    we cannot directly modify cart slice
    how to write data
        we have to dispatch an action
        when we dispatch an action it calls a function (reducer function)
        the function can modify the slice of redux store

    how to read data from slice
        we will use selector to read data from store
        and the selector will modify the component
        when we use selector it is knows as subscribing the the store
        subscribing means to be in sync with store
        if the data in slice changes it updates the component

configureStore - redux-toolkit
    reducers of appStore for different slices
